!     Description of the module :
!
!        Print an error message and stop the program
!        This is a simplified version of the original to make sure
!        that the message is always visible.
!
!        Reason:
!        On Windows files opened to a unit number in the main program
!        seem to be independent of the files opened to the same unit
!        number in a DLL. As the original writes to the monitoring
!        file, the message would be hidden in a file like "fort.88"
!
    character*(*) string

    write(*,*) string
    write(*,*) 'The program stopped because of this'
    read (*,*)
    stop (1)
