function [xy,cLabels,cv] = process_polygons(xy,fc,cv,Thresholds)
%PROCESS_POLYGONS Convert MATLAB patch data to polygons (with holes).
%   [XYP,CLABEL,CVP] = PROCESS_POLYGONS(XY,FC,CV,MINMAX) expects as input
%   a cell array of vertices of the patches plotted by (tri)contourf (XY),
%   a cell array of faces (definitions) of the patches plotted (FC), a cell
%   array of the facevertexcdata (color) data of patches plotted (CV) and
%   an Nx2 array containing the Min and Max Threshold values for each
%   patch. It returns a cell array of length K containing the coordinates
%   of each polygon (XYP), a cell array of length 2 containing the names of
%   the values (cLabels), and an array of size Kx2 with the minimum and
%   maximum value per polygon (CVP).
%
%   The contourf function plots a number of overlapping patches creating
%   the illusion of shaded areas between contour lines. The area may even
%   have holes represented by patches copying the color of the axes/figure.
%   This function processes the geometric data and generates complex patch
%   definitions (possibly with holes) that can be exported to GIS as
%   polygons.
%
%   The tricontourf function plots a large number of triangles creating the
%   illusion of large shaded areas between contour lines. This function
%   processes the geometric data and generates merged complex partch
%   definitions (possibly with holes) that can be exported to GIS as
%   polygons.
%
%   Example:
%      [C, H] = contourf(...);
%      XY = get(H,'vertices');
%      FC = get(H,'faces');
%      CV = get(H,'facevertexcdata');
%      MINMAX = zeros(length(H),2);
%      for ip = 1:length(H)
%         MINMAX(ip,:) = [getappdata(H(ip),'MinThreshold') ...
%                         getappdata(H(ip),'MaxThreshold')];
%      end
%      [XYP,CLABEL,CVP] = process_polygons(XY,FC,CV,MINMAX);
%
%   Example:
%      H = contourf(...);
%      XY = get(H,'vertices');
%      FC = get(H,'faces');
%      CV = get(H,'facevertexcdata');
%      MINMAX = zeros(length(H),2);
%      for ip = 1:length(H)
%         MINMAX(ip,:) = [getappdata(H(ip),'MinThreshold') ...
