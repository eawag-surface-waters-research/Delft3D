      module m_fixinf

      implicit none

      contains


!  Purpose of this module: modify some of the boundary conditions for
!  infeasible systems. We follow a different approach for different
!  model versions for reasons to be explained here. Infeasible systems
!  occur, when a minimum constrain (usually a mortality constraint)
!  conflicts with a maximum constraint (nutrient; energy). To deal with
!  this problem we must either lower the value of the mortality
!  constraint, or increase the available amount of the maximum
!  constraint, which is violated.
!
!  1. Stand alone BLOOM II
!     a. Steady state computation.
!        If there is no valid solution, simply put all biomasses to 0.0:
!        this is obviously the correct steady state solution.
!     b. Dynamic computation.
!        Drop the mortality constraint which is violated. Argument:
!        the boundary conditions are based on measured conditions and
!        therefore relatively well defined. Little is known about the
!        mortality of declining species. Therefore drop the moratlity
!        constraint.
!   2. BLOOM as a module (DELWAQ; JSBACH)
!        The mortality is pre-calculated and so are the corresponding
!        nutrient fluxes. Conflicts between nutrient and mortality
!        constraints cannot occur in theory (they do occasionally though
!        due to numerical round-off errors and small time-step
!        problems). In almost all cases the infeasibility is caused by
!        a mortality constraint and the energy constraint. Therefore
!        try to increase the energy consrtaint sufficiently and rerun
!        the problem. If this won't help, drop the mortality constraint.
!        Note: this may lead to NEGATIVE production rates as BLOOM
!        returns a value below the mortality constraint!
