! EFFI, however, to compute the coefficients for the objective

! When Kmax is negative for a species, its biomass should approach
! zero as quickly as possible. Therefore put 0.01 in the objective

! of the species could be positive, indicating that it should be

! However, as an extra precaution for dealing with infeasible
! solutions put XINIT into the growth constraint: whatever
! is done with the other constraints, this particular type will not
! increase in biomass.
