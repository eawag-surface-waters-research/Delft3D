      SUBROUTINE DELMAT (N,NUC,NLC,M,A,B,IOPT)
!
!         THE SUBROUTINE DELMAT IS A DELFT-HYDRAULICS-LABORATORY
!         PRODUCT TO SOLVE SETS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS DESCRIBED BY
!         BAND MATRICES WITH LARGEST ELEMENTS ON THE DIAGONAL.
!         THE MAKER GIVES NO WARRANTY CONCERNING PROPER SOLUTIONS.
!         NOTHING OF THE CODE CAN BE REPRODUCED WITHOUT PERMISSION
!         OF THE MAKER
!
!         THE SUBROUTINE EXPECTS THE MATRIX "A" TO BE STORED IN A
!         ONE DIMENSIONAL EQUIVALENT OF THE TWO DIMENSIONAL MATRIX
!         REPRESENTATION. IN TWO DIMENSIONAL FORM THE STORAGE RULES
!         USED BY THE IMSL PACKAGE FOR BAND MATRICES MUST BE USED.
!         HOWEVER THE ROWS AND COLLUMNS MUST BE INTERCHANGED.
!         THE SAME HOLDS FOR THE FULL MATRIX OF KNOWN VECTORS "B".
