!>            This routine performs per open boundary condition:
!>            - at outflow, updates last saved outflow concentration bsave
!>            - at outflow, sets open boundary condition to this outflow value
!>            - at inflow, set open boundary condition to:
!>                  - prescribed value if inflow time larger then time lag
!>                  - evaluates Tatcher-Harleman boundary if inflow time is less
