!     Created   :          2007 by Pauline van Slingerland

!     Modified  : November 2009 by Leo Postma : dlwqm7 was split off for all substances

!     Note      : This routine takes 3 times as much computation time than the more complicated
!                 dlwqm1 routine. The only reason for that is that the 2 dimensional indices of
!                 the velo and disper arrays should have noq as first dimension rather than second.
!                 For the coarse Hong Kong situation with 37500 volumes and 20 substances, the full
!                 span of 20*37500*4 = 3 Mb of the disper array schould be read and approximately
!                 half of it for the velo array. This is done 20 times per time step, so 90 Mb per
!                 time step. With a 1066 MHz front side bus and the DDR3 memory of the Intel T9400
!                 processor of my portable this takes 60/2 = 30 ms per time step or 7 seconds for
!                 240 time steps for the test computation. If the 2 indexes are interchanged, only
!                 4.5 Mb should be transported, which costs only 360 ms for the test.
