!! Trachytope module containing FM data for trachytopes.
!! Note that arrays are dimensioned on the number of net links
!! This was done so that roughness characteristics can be specified
!! not related to the location of open boundaries, which are not
!! yet available at the time the model is constructed.
!! Besides that certain sediment transport formulae require a
!! Cf at the flow node, which can only accurately be deterimined if the
!! values at net links are known.
